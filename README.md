- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Optimho, I live  in New Zealand and work as a maintenance engineer at a number  of geothermal power stations in the area.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in electronics and programming. I am reasonably well versed with the Pycom, Raspberry PI and PICO. I use python and a bit of C as my programming tool of choice  
- ðŸ‘€ I do some work developing low power sensor and like to use Loarawan for longer range communication with a mobile network. Sensors that I am currenlty working with are air quality sensors for rental accommodation.

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently learning Dart as I would like to be able to use a smart phone in some of my electronic endevors.
